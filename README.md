# KstApp

ON4KST Chat app with Push Notification support. Based on the great work done
by the [QLog
team](https://github.com/foldynl/QLog/blob/master/service/kstchat/KSTChat.cpp).

## Installation
Unfortunately KstApp currently is not available from the Apple Appstore. However 
you can either compile it from source using XCode or install it using [AltStore](https://altstore.io/). Here is the [altstore source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrbayer84/KstApp/refs/heads/main/altstore-source.json) file. Tap "Sources" on the bottom and then the plus in the top left corner. Then tap the KstApp source and click on the "free" button next to KstApp.
